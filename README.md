# Supermarket Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a supermarket sales dataset using Python. The focus is on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generating insights about sales trends, customer behavior, and revenue patterns.

## Data Cleaning
- Checked for and confirmed no missing values.
- Verified that there were no duplicate entries.
- Ensured data consistency by standardizing categorical values.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Used `seaborn` and `matplotlib` to visualize key trends.
- Analyzed sales distribution over time to identify peak periods.
- Investigated relationships between customer type, payment methods, and total sales.
- Examined product category performance to determine best-selling items.

## Key Insights
- **No missing or duplicate values**: The dataset was clean and ready for analysis.
- **Peak Sales Periods**: Higher sales were observed during specific hours and days.
- **Customer Spending Behavior**: Different customer types exhibited distinct purchasing patterns.
- **Payment Method Preferences**: Customers preferred specific payment methods for certain types of transactions.
- **Revenue Breakdown**: Certain product categories contributed more significantly to total revenue.

## Usage
